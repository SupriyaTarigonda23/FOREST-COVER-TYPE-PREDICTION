# FOREST-COVER-TYPE-PREDICTION
Ensemble learning approach methods find application in solving various problems ranging from a bit harder to severe complexity problems. These models in Machine Learning are known for their better predicting results for any given large data sets. Here in the project we worked on various ensemble learning approaches for solving a problem on “Identifying Forest Cover”. The dataset for the given problem comprises of some features collected on the forest cover and also explaining the fit of various models for the given problem
In this experiment we will be analysing various machine learning algorithm on Forest Cover Type. We need to predict the cover type using the given data. We will also analyse various parameters of the applied algorithm and view the effect on the dataset. Parameter tuning using Grid search is done. The dataset is asking one to predict the type of forest cover from given cartographic variables. The actual forest cover was modelled into a 30 by 30-meter cell and was issued by USFS. The study includes four different types of wilderness areas and 7 different types namely Spruce, Lodgepole Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Cottonwood, Aspen, Douglas-fir, Krummholz.
